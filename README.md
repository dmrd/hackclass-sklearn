# Machine learning with sklearn
This is the set of IPython notebooks I used for the intro ML class I taught for
introtohacking.github.io

Use the  [IPython slide viewer](https://slideviewer.herokuapp.com/github/dmrd/hackclass-sklearn/blob/master/presentation.ipynb#/) to view the
main presentation, and [IPython nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org) to view the
rest.

This presentation has been pieced together from my own knowledge and tutorials
such as the [Scipy2013 sklearn
tutorial](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/glouppe/tutorial-sklearn-scipy2013/tree/master/rendered_notebooks/)
mentioned above (particularly for some visualizations and the eigenfaces
example).  Other sources include [Andreas Mueller's excellent sklearn
presentation](https://amueller.github.io/sklearn_tutorial/) and the many
tutorials available in the sklearn documentation.
